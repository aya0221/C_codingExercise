Question 5:
Use the definition of Θ in order to show the following:

a.5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n = Θ(𝑛^3)

The fastest growing term is 5n^3. 
If the coefficient is taken out, remaining is 𝑛^3.
Therefore 5n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n = Θ(𝑛^3).



b. √(7n^2 +2n−8)= Θ(𝑛)

The fastest growing term is √(7n^2). 
If the coefficient is taken out, remaining is √(n^2).
√(n^2)= n
Therefore  √(7n^2 +2n−8)= Θ(𝑛).
