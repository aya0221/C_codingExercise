/*
1. Write a function int fib(int n) that returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci
sequence.

2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer num, and then
prints the numâ€™s elements in the Fibonacci sequence.
Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:
Please enter a positive integer: 7
13
